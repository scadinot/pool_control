# Pool Control

_Plugin permettant de gérer la filtration d'une piscine en fonction de la température._

_Component _

This custom component for Home Assistant can be used to automatically control
a pool pump that is turned on/off by a switch that Home Assistant can control.

This component is based on the work of [@scadinot](https://github.com/scadinot/pool).

I will adapt it to my needs. At completion this plugin will compute the filtering
schedule taking into account the pool water temperature.

## Minimum requirements

* A switch supported in Home Assistant that can turn on/off power to your pool pump.
